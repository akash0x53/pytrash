Introduction
------------

The pytrash is a command line tool for the GNOME Trash.
The pytrash includes the follow scripts:

trash
	removes files or directories to the GNOME Trash.

undel
	undeletes the files or directories from the GNOME Trash.

emptytrash
	really deletes files or directories in the GNOME Trash.

See '--help' option of each script. 

INSTALL
-------

Edit a PATH variable of a pytrash/__init__.py file to specify the correct path for the GNOME Trash.
The deafult path is a '.local/share/Trash'.

$ python setup.py install

HOW TO USE
----------

Make a alias for the trash script as the "rm" command.

$ alias rm=trash

You can use the "rm" same as before and undelete files or directories
by the undel script.

TODO
----

- The symbolic link are simply deleted and cannot undelete.
